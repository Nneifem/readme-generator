# readme-generator

## Description
This project was built to generate a README file that is properly formatted when the information needed is inputted. This solves the issue of having to frequently check the syntax every time, make sure that you are not missing a section by mistake, and overall a quicker way to write a README easily. Working on this, I broaden my skills in JavaScript by learning how to use node, npm, and inquirer.
